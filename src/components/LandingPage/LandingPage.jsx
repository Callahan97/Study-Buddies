          Thank you for choosing Study Buddies for your tutelage needs. We are dedicated to providing a simple yet intuitive platform where tutors and tutees can connect and schedule study sessions.
          </p>
  
          <p>
          Our mission is guided by the motto: <strong><em>"Docendo Discimus"</em></strong> â€” which means, <strong>"by teaching, we learn."</strong> We believe that education is a two-way street, and not only do our tutees gain valuable knowledge, but our tutors also grow through the process of teaching and helping others.
          </p>
  
          <p>
          We sincerely appreciate your trust in Study Buddies. While we currently serve the Rochester, MN area, we are excited about the future and plan to expand our services in the coming months.
          </p>
